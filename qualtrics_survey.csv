It seems taking from se Oklahoma is becoming a common practice with people outside our communities. If the board owns the water then it seems only fair the residents that live here should be compensated for floods, livestock lost, etc. At minimum okc should reach an agreement with those along the river to purchase the water. Taking a resource from an area and giving nothing back is almost stealing. Its literally resource redistribution.","Pass"
